# Create-Plus-Plus
Create Plus Plus is a beta Forge modpack built for Minecraft 1.20.1, designed to enhance the automation and creativity of the recently updated Create Mod with a carefully curated set of compatible addons. This modpack also integrates Applied Energistics 2, Tomâ€™s Simple Storage, and more, bringing modern storage and automation to the immersive mechanical world of Create.

As my first modpack, this project is still evolving. Expect visual and practical improvements over time as more addons become compatible and quality-of-life enhancements are introduced. Whether you're building intricate machines or managing advanced systems, Create Plus Plus offers a fresh, expandable sandbox for tech-minded players.
